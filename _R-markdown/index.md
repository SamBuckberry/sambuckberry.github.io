========================================================
I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Robinson Research Institute and The University of Adelaide, and my research is focused in the areas of genome biology and bioinformatics.

Although the challenge no longer lies in generating genome scale data, I think significant challenges remain in developing the most informative and efficient ways to collect, analyse and interpret these vast datasets. I spend most of my time developing ways to use massive amounts of genomic data to increase our understanding of how the genome is regulated. I'm also interested in data visualisation, science communication and reproducible research methods.
