This is a list of bioinformatics databases and web tools I have found useful in the past or think I may find useful in the future. Use with caution... no guarantees or endorsements here.

[**Sequence Manipulation Suite**](http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/index.html): A collection of JavaScript programs for generating, formatting, and analyzing short DNA and protein sequences.

[**oPossum**](http://opossum.cisreg.ca/oPOSSUM3/): A web-based system for the detection of over-represented conserved transcription factor binding sites and binding site combinations in sets of genes or sequences. 

[**RPBDB**](http://rbpdb.ccbr.utoronto.ca/index.php): A database of RNA-binding protein specificities.

[**4D genome**](http://4dgenome.int-med.uiowa.edu/): A general repository for chromatin interaction data.
