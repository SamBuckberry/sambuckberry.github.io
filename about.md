Sam Buckberry is a molecular and computational biologist who specalises in epigenetics and genomics. He is currently a NHMRC-ARC Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Lister Lab](http://listerlab.org) at [The University of Western Australia](http://www.uwa.edu.au/) and the [Harry Perkins Institute for Medical Research](http://www.perkins.org.au).

Sam's research utilises an integrative genomics approach to understand the principles and mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation in cell reprogramming, pluripotency and differentiation into neuronal cell lineages. This is achieved through combining cutting-edge genomics techniques and novel bioinformatics approaches.
