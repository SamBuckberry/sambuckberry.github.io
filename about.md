Hi, I'm Sam Buckberry. I'm a postdoctoral researcher in genome bioinformatics in the [Lister Lab](http://listerlab.org) at [The University of Western Australia](http://www.uwa.edu.au/). 

Before joining the Lister Lab in July 2015, I completed a PhD at [The University of Adelaide](http://www.adelaide.edu.au) (2012-2015). My PhD research was largely focused on developing computational methods for analysing RNA sequencing data and performing an integrative transcriptome analysis of the human fetal-maternal interface. A lot of my PhD work is publicly available, including [published papers](http://sambuckberry.github.io/publications/) and [R packages](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/massiR.html).

If you would like to get in touch with me, collaborate on a project, or find out more about my work, you can email me at sambuckberry \<at\> gmail \<dotcom\>  or through one of the links below.
