Sam Buckberry is a molecular and computational biologist who specalises in epigenetics and genomics. He is currently a NHMRC-ARC Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Lister Lab](http://listerlab.org) at [The University of Western Australia](http://www.uwa.edu.au/). 

Sam research employes an integrative genomics approach to understand the principles and mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation in cell reprogramming, pluripotency and differentiation into neuronal cell lineages.

His current research is focused on deciphering the role of the epigenome in neuronal gene regulation and stem cell reprogramming by combining cutting-edge DNA sequencing techniques, bioinformatics and statistical modeling.
